# WordPress Quick Install
A single-file installer for WordPress, designed to get you up-and-running in
minutes!

Originally created by [Dion Hulse](http://dd32.id.au/).

## Developing
If you're using Git, simply fork and develop away:

	git clone https://github.com/[you!]/wpqi.git

For those holdouts who still want to use Subversion, you can use GitHub's SVN
bridge instead:

	svn checkout https://github.com/[you!]/wpqi

But you should avoid that. :)

Patches are accepted by pull requests. Raw patch/diff files will most likely
not be considered.
