# WordPress Quick Install
A single-file installer for WordPress, designed to get you up-and-running in
minutes!

## Downloading

	git clone https://github.com/rmccue/wpqi.git

Or, for the SVN users amongst you:

	svn checkout https://github.com/rmccue/wpqi

You can also grab a [copy of the latest code as a
zip](https://github.com/rmccue/wpqi/zipball/master).

## Forking
If you're using Git, simply fork via GitHub and develop away:

	git clone https://github.com/[you!]/wpqi.git

For those holdouts who still want to use Subversion, you can use GitHub's SVN
bridge instead:

	svn checkout https://github.com/[you!]/wpqi

But you should avoid that. :)

Patches are accepted by pull requests. Raw patch/diff files will most likely
not be considered.

## Setup

1. Clone a copy of [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) into `wp-files`
2. Run `php build.php`
